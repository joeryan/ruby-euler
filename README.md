Project Euler problems in Ruby for practice in Ruby 2.2

My repository for [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) problems.  You are
welcome to read any of my solutions of course, but it's always better to try
to solve them on your own first.

If you have comments about how they could be refactored, I'd be happy to hear
from you.  However, trolls will get no response from me.  I don't believe they
exist and don't talk to my imagination!
